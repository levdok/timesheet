## For what? 
The script moves your timesheets from Toggl to Jira Tempo. 

## How does it works? 
Set settings.ini:
Add toggle's and tempo's tokens and tempo's authorAccountId.
Set lastsuccessful. It is date and time in ISO which search in Toggl will be performed from.
Set defaultkey. It is a default Jira's key which will be used if you don't set key in Toggle
Set defaultdescription. It is a default description for Tempo which will be used if you don't set it on Toggle.

Use Toggl as usual. You can write also Jira's ticket key in optional.
